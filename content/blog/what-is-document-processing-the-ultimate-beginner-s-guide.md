## **2. What is Document Processing?**

### **Definition of Document Processing**

So, **what is document processing**? At its core, document processing refers to the method of capturing, extracting, and managing data from various document formats. This includes converting unstructured information into a structured, machine-readable format that can be easily stored, searched, and analyzed. Whether it's invoices, contracts, or customer forms, **processing documents** efficiently ensures that critical data is readily accessible.

Key aspects of document processing:

- **Data Capture**: Digitizing physical documents through scanning or imaging.
- **Data Extraction**: Using software to pull relevant information from documents.
- **Data Management**: Organizing and storing extracted data for easy retrieval.

### **Evolution from Traditional to Intelligent Document Processing**

The journey of document processing has evolved significantly over the years:

- **Traditional Methods**: Initially, **paperwork processing** was entirely manual, involving physical handling of documents and manual data entry into systems—a time-consuming and error-prone process.
- **Early Automation**: The advent of basic [Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) allowed for rudimentary digitization of printed text, but with limitations in accuracy and flexibility.
- **Intelligent Document Processing (IDP)**: Today, we have advanced systems capable of understanding, extracting, and processing data from a variety of document types. IDP leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to handle complex documents and improve over time.

This evolution underscores the shift from manual **documents processing** to intelligent solutions that enhance efficiency, accuracy, and scalability.
