            <p>
              To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall DigiParser (Legal name: Patidar Consultancy) or its suppliers be
              liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever

              Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation
              of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some
              of the above limitations may not apply. In these states, each party's
              liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.
            </p>

              foregoing, DigiParser (Legal name: Patidar Consultancy) provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no
              representation of any kind that the Service will meet Your requirements,
              achieve any intended results, be compatible or work with any other software,

              defects can or will be corrected.
            </p>
            <p>
              Without limiting the foregoing, neither DigiParser (Legal name: Patidar Consultancy) nor any of the company's

              reliability, or currency of any information or content provided through the
              Service; or (iv) that the Service, its servers, the content, or e-mails sent
              from or on behalf of DigiParser (Legal name: Patidar Consultancy) are free of viruses, scripts, trojan

              Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties
              or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all

              case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be
              applied to the greatest extent enforceable under applicable law.
